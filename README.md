# Professional Development Playlists, Courses, Trainings, Podcasts, and Books
Professional development playlists - spatial, cartography, data science, machine learning, data management, and related programming conference proceedings as videos, paper repositories, and then separate webinars and podcast links

Links to conference video playlists, and if available, proceedings go here. Courses, one-off webinars/trainings, podcasts, and books go in separate files to be created soon. The goal is to be able to browse by content type and quickly pull up videos/papers, where possible, but also to be able to browse for other resources.
