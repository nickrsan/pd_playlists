# Professional Development Playlists, Courses, Trainings, Podcasts, and Books for Spatial, Data Science, ML, and Programming
Professional development playlists - spatial, cartography, data science, machine learning, data management, and related programming conference proceedings as videos, paper repositories, and then separate webinars and podcast links

## Sections
Links to conference video playlists, and if available, proceedings go here. Courses, one-off webinars/trainings, podcasts, and books go in separate files, some to be created soon. The goal is to be able to browse by content type and quickly pull up videos/papers, where possible, but also to be able to browse for other resources.
